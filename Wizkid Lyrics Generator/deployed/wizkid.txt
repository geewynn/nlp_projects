Brown skin girl
Your skin just like pearls
The best thing in the world
Never trade you for anybody else
Singin' brown skin girl
Your skin just like pearls
The best thing in the world
I never trade you for anybody else, singin'...
She said she really grew up poor like me
Don't believe in nothin' but the almighty
Just a likkle jeans and a pure white tee
She never did forever be nobody wifey, yeah
So while I may not pretty boy, your heart is amiss
Play it like a villain 'cause she caught in a wave
Tonight I am walkin' away
9 to 5 mind, on the grind, yeah, yeah
Tonight I might fall in love, dependin' on how you hold me
I'm glad that I'm calmin' down, can't let no one come control me
Keep dancin' and call it love, she fightin' but fallin' slowly
If ever you are in doubt, remember what mama told me
Brown skin girl, ya skin just like pearls
Your back against the world

Brown skin girl, ya skin just like pearls
The best thing in all the world

Pose like a trophy when Naomis walk in
She need an Oscar for that pretty dark skin
Pretty like Lupita when the cameras close in
Drip broke the levee when my Kellys roll in
I think tonight she might braid her braids
Melanin too dark to throw her shade
She minds her business and wines her waist
Gold like 24k, okay
Tonight I might fall in love, dependin' on how you hold me
I'm glad that I'm calmin' down, can't let no one come control me
Keep dancin' and call it love, she fightin' but fallin' slowly
If ever you are in doubt, remember what mama told me
Brown skin girl, ya skin just like pearls
Your back against the world
I never trade you for anybody else, say
Brown skin girl, ya skin just like pearls
The best thing in all the world
I never trade you for anybody else, say
Oh, have you looked in the mirror lately? 
Wish you could trade eyes with me 
There's complexities in complexion
But your skin, it glow like diamonds
Dig me like the earth, you be giving birth
Took everything in life, baby, know your worth
I love everything about you, from your nappy curls
To every single curve, your body natural
Same skin that was broken be the same skin takin' over
Most things out of focus, view
But when you're in the room, they notice you 
'Cause you're beautiful
Yeah, you're beautiful
Them men, them gon' fall in love with you and all of your glory
Your skin is not only dark, it shines and it tells your story
Keep dancin', they can't control you
They watchin', they all adore you
If ever you are in doubt, remember what mama told you
Brown skin girl , ya skin just like pearls

I just can't explain
I can't explain, no, no
Look, it's gon' be a long long time 'fore we stop
Boy better know, they better know who make the scene pop
All I ever needed was a chance to get the team hot
Only thing I fear is a headshot or a screenshot
Pree me, dem a pree me
You know they only ever call em when they need me
I never go anywhere, they never see me
I'm the type to take it easy, take it easy
I took girls in the very first text I sent
I don't beg no lovers, I don't beg no friends
If you wanna link, we can link right now
Skeppy Wiz and Drake, it's a ting right now
Are you feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
Oh, I can’t explain

I am feeling good tonight
This thing got me thanking God for life
I can’t explain
I can’t explain eh yeah
When I was in school, being African was a diss
Sounds like you need help saying my surname, Miss
Tried to communicate
But everyday is like another episode of Everybody Hates Chris
Ever since mum said, "Son you are a king"
I feel like Floyd when I'm stepping into the ring
Just spoke to the boy, said he's flying in with a ting
We're touching the road to celebrate another win, we're going in
Why am I repping these ends? Man I don't know
The government played roulette with my postcode
All I know is it's where my people dem are suffering
I seen it before, narrate the story as it unfolds
Dad certified the settings and my mum knows
My mind full of more bullets than your gun holds
Now I got the peng tings in the front row
Saying, "Skeppy come home, baby come home!"
Yeah, I love the sun but I respect the rain
Look forward to good times, can't forget the pain
I was the kid in school with the £10 shoes
White socks, jack-ups and the pepper grains
Said they're gonna respect me for my ambition
Rest in peace my niggas that are missing
I had to tell my story cause they'd rather show you
Black kids with flies on their faces on the television

True, ay
I'm tryna get paid, take money, cash cheques
You see the set, that's Lash, that's Dex
Young C, Young Shorty, Milkavelli
White bricks, True Religion, on the telly, it's me
Wiz got the house full of freaks
That's why I haven't been around for a week
I'm getting pounds in my sleep
I'm at the top of the mountain, it's peak
Bring it back before the villain
I had a life, real talk, True Religion
It's in the blood, in the genes, in the stitching
Walked in, no weapon, made a killing
Tongue kissing pretty women
New iPhone 'cause I'm done with all the bitching
Tryna be in my position
Keep my shades on 'cause they tryna see the vision
She tell me, "Badman, see, I need your love, see, I need your love"
Mi need you close to me, me, I tell her say me, oh, stay on the road
Bad energy stay far away, make it stay far away
Just give me love for the night, give me love for the night, gyal, waste no time
Breakfast in bed on a plane
I could never complain
I was walking with the limp, had the cane
Dex said greatness and nothing was the same
Now we're set for life
I saw the turn up button and I pressed it twice
You heard I'm in the club, then my best advice
Is put your shoes on and come and get your wife
'Cause we've been having sex just for exercise
Every night, man are doing sexercise
She looks into my eyes, now she's mesmerised
She tell me, "Badman, see, I need your love, see, I need your love"
Mi need you close to me, me, I tell her say me, oh, stay on the road
Bad energy stay far away, make you stay far away
Just give me love for the night, give me love for the night, gyal, waste no time
Ay, they better get used to the flex
African man, you see the jewels on my neck
Black James Bond, that's the new silhouette
You see me in the street and I was moving correct
Been running around, tryna do the home run
Left that girl, she was no fun
I tie one, smoke one
Big chief Skeppy and I answer to no one
Counting my blessings, I'm feeling special
Bird's eye view, SK level
Give them the Shaku when I dance with the devil
Young Fela Kuti, the return of the rebel
I told her I need some space
Real busy body, never stay in one place
And she knows I've got more tricks under my sleeve
That's why she never wants me to leave
She tell me, "Badman, see, I need your love, see, I need your love"
Mi need you close to me, me, I tell her say me, oh, stay on the road
Bad energy stay far away, make you stay far away
Just give me love for the night, give me love for the night, gyal, waste no timeYea, yea, yea, yea
